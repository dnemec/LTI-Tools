# About
This is a MATLAB script for basic analysis of an LTI system up to the 5th order.  
Script is very readable so you may easily expand it and adjust to your liking.  
It has a command line input of coefficients and GUI for choosing the plot type.  
After selection of plot type it automatically saves the high resolution .png plot image file in your MATLAB working directory.  
It is usually located in:  
```
C:/User/MyDocuments/MATLAB
```
or in case of MacOS in:  
```
Macintosh/Users/username/Documents/MATLAB
```

## Dependencies
This script requires the [Control Systems Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/help/control/index.html).  
Unfortunately it doesn't work properly in GNU Octave because of missing equivalent functions in control package.

## Language
lti_tools.m is english version of the script.  
lti_tools_HR.m is croatian version of the script.
